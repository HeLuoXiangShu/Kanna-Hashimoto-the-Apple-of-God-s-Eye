有兩種人不相信運氣，一種是至今運氣不錯所以認為成就全靠努力得來，另一種則是運氣較差且十分穩定毫無波瀾。另一方面，有兩種人相信運氣，一種是經歷了人生的沈浮明白了身不由己的苦衷，而另一種則是被幸運之神眷顧輕而易舉得到一切的寵兒。今天我們要分享的是紅極一時的女星橋本環奈的命盤，探討她為何如此幸運。

There are two types of people who don't believe in luck. The first type is those who have always had good luck and believe that their achievements are solely due to their hard work. The second type is those who have consistently had bad luck and believe that luck doesn't exist at all. On the other hand, there are two types of people who believe in luck. The first type is those who have experienced the ups and downs of life and understand the helplessness of fate. The second type is those who are favored by the god of luck and effortlessly obtain everything they desire. Today, we will share the natal chart of the popular actress Kanna Hashimoto and explore why she is so lucky.

橋本環奈於1999年2月3日13時16分生於日本福岡，2013年11月因為公演照片太過可愛被大量網友讚嘆，被評為千年一遇的美少女，由此打開了知名度，帶來大量代言和出演機會。

Kanna Hashimoto was born on February 3, 1999, at 13:16 in Fukuoka, Japan. Her popularity skyrocketed in November 2013 when numerous online users praised her cute stage photos, proclaiming her as a once-in-a-millennium beauty. This increased visibility opened doors to numerous endorsement deals and acting opportunities for her.

### 天生幸運兒 Born lucky

在橋本環奈的星盤中，最引人注目的是位於雙魚座本宮的木星，且在九分盤中也同樣位於雙魚座，成為極其吉利的Vargottama配置。木星掌管第七和第十宮，因此代表她的事業將受到許多有影響力的男性貴人的幫助，與他們的關係將非常良好，甚至可能因緣份而結為連理。此外，她的星盤中還有位於第十宮的廟旺雙魚座金星，預示著她的事業也受到金星的影響，並且她的工作環境將和諧，待人接物彬彬有禮，因此吸引了許多女性追隨者。綜合來看，橋本環奈是一位情商極高的藝人，不論是在工作環境或簽約等一對一的交往中，都非常幸運。

Jupiter in Pisces is the most remarkable aspect in her natal chart, as it is in its own sign and can fully exhibit its beneficial effects. This auspicious placement is further enhanced by its presence in the Navamsha chart, creating a Vargottama configuration. Jupiter, as the ruler of the seventh and tenth houses, represents the influential men who will help pave the way for Kanna Hashimoto's career, and her relationship with them will be positive, possibly leading to marriage through professional connections. Additionally, the exalted Venus in Pisces is located in the tenth house, indicating that her career will also be influenced by Venus. Her work environment will be harmonious, and she will conduct herself politely and courteously, attracting many female followers. Overall, Hikaru Hashimoto is an artist with exceptional emotional intelligence, and she is fortunate in both her work environment and one-on-one interactions, such as signing contracts.

### 天使面孔大叔性格 Angel face with masculine personality

占星學中，第一宮與性格氣質有關，第二宮則與五官面容相關。橋本環奈的第一宮位於雙子座，宮主水星落於第九宮與太陽合相，同時被位於本宮的天蠍座火星所映射。水星代表善辯靈活，而太陽和火星則代表純陽性的特質。因此，命主的性格偏向於傳統意義上男性的特質。此外，太陽位於Vargottama，其力量更加強大，也為命主帶來了強勢和貴氣的氣質。
第二宮的宮主是月亮，位於處女座，落在第四宮。月亮代表陰性的柔美特質，而被強勢的金星和木星所影響。金星象徵美的化身，而木星則擴大了美的影響力。因此，命主的五官和面容都非常漂亮。

In astrology, the first house is associated with personality and temperament, while the second house is related to facial features. Kanna Hashimoto's first house is in Gemini with Mercury as the ruler, which is located in the ninth house conjunct the Sun. Mars in the first house in Scorpio aspects Mercury. Mercury represents eloquence and agility, while the Sun and Mars both represent pure masculine traits. Therefore, the native's personality tends to be more masculine in the traditional sense. Furthermore, the Sun is located in Vargottama, which enhances its power and brings a strong and noble aura to the native's temperament.
The Moon rules the second house, which is located in Virgo and falls in the fourth house. The Moon represents soft and feminine qualities and is aspected by the strong Venus and Jupiter. Venus embodies beauty, while Jupiter expands the influence of beauty. As a result, the native's facial features are exceptionally beautiful.

### 好運還將持續 Good luck will continue

橋本環奈出生于戊寅年乙丑月丙戌日甲午时，地支三合火局，丙火旺盛，且食神和印星均有根气。像许多美女演员一樣，她的命格也是食伤佩印的格局，這在演藝事業上很有優勢。丙火日主就像太阳一样，自然地照耀世人，而丙火出生的人如果在白天出生，会更容易受到关注。相反地，夜晚出生的丙火则容易感到情绪低落。冬天的丙火命格通常不被看好，因为冬季阳光不足。但是，橋本環奈出生在午时，也就是太阳光最充足的时候，且地支火局转旺，印星又有根气来生旺日主。因此，她拥有冬日暖阳的优势，让人们喜爱她。

要充分展现丙火的美丽，需要运用官杀星，特别是壬水。就像太阳照耀在水面上熠熠发光一样，壬水能够让丙火命格更加璀璨。原局月令丑土中含水，但是不透也不旺，因此需要等待大运流年水势转强且官杀星显现，这样才能带来名利双收的好运。

从盲派八字的技法来分析，橋本環奈的八字是标准的大富之命，气势强旺。地支寅午戌三合火局，制月令丑土，三合之局的中神在主位能为我所用，所制之财在宾位，用自己的力量去拿到外面的财。月令之财是大财，而丑土包含财以及财的原神，一同被制，为巨财。此外，丑土中还含有正官癸水，一同被克制，无论男人还是金钱都是橋本環奈的囊中之物。

2008年開始起甲子大運，甲字五年為印星生丙火，童年被家裡照顧得不錯，待到子字五年也就是2013年開始，水氣轉旺，而流年天干又是癸水，11月初流月壬戌，日照江河之象，開始在網絡上爆紅，由此真正開啟了藝人事業。

2018年起癸亥大運，繼續補充水氣，2022壬寅年壬子月擔任紅白歌會的主持人，光彩照人。2028年起壬戌大運，前五年壬水運勢將會是演藝生涯的又一高峰。從星盤推運來看也是一致的結論。2031年12月左右，時間週期可以放寬至1年內，是木星大運的成熟點。此時，上天給予的運氣會帶來命中注定的成功，至少會有事業方面的好消息，比如代表作的推出、橫掃多個獎項等。如果在這之前還沒有結婚，這個節點也很有可能會步入婚姻的殿堂。總而言之，是人生的高光時刻。

此後2037-2057年的大運將是財運大發，也許會退出幕前工作轉型經商，獲取豐厚的財富。但是，隨著年齡的增長，接下來的運勢會大幅下滑，特別是2058年開始走己未大運衝月令丑土，與日支戌一起構成三刑，嚴重刑克丑土中的癸水，也就是正官星。正所謂傷官見官，流年再逢正官星透出之年2063癸未年，其夫必有災，若無夫則是個人事業有災。

Kanna Hashimoto was born in a year of Earth Tiger, in the month of Wood Ox, on the day of Fire Dog, and during the hour of Wood Horse. Her earthly branches form a harmony of fire pattern to make Yang Fire prosperous, with strong influence from the fire element and both the Food Deity and Seal rooted in her chart. This pattern of Food Deity with supporting Direct Seal is advantageous for a successful career in the entertainment industry, much like many other beautiful actresses.

As the Yang Fire Day Master, those born under the sign of Yang Fire are like the sun, naturally shining upon the world and more easily noticed if born during the daytime. Conversely, those born at night may feel more emotionally low. The Yang Fire Day Master is not typically favorable in winter when sunlight is scarce, but Kanna Hashimoto was born during the hour of the Horse, when the sun is at its fullest, with her earthly branches in a strong fire formation and the Seal rooted and supporting the Yang Fire Day Master. Hence, she has the advantage of the warm winter sun, which makes people love her even more.

To fully showcase the beauty of Kanna Hashimoto's Yang Fire, it is essential to make use of the Direct Officer and Indirect Officer elements, particularly Yang Water as the Indirect Officer. Just as the sun shining on water creates a sparkling effect, the combination of Yang Water and Yang Fire can make her even more radiant.  Although there is water in the earthly branch Ox, it is not strong enough to bring significant benefits. Thus, Kanna Hashimoto needs to wait for a more influential water element to appear in a favorable year, along with the appearance of the Direct Officer and Indirect Officer in her chart. This combination will bring her good fortune and fame.

Using the techniques of "blind school", Kanna Hashimoto's chart is a classic example of a wealthy and powerful chart with a strong and prosperous aura. Her earthly branches form a harmony of fire pattern, which controls the earthly branch Ox. The Horse as the central factor of the harmony of fire pattern is in the host position, while the wealth star inside the earth branch Ox is in the guest position, thus she can use her own power to obtain wealth from outside. The wealth in the month earthly branch is significant, and the Earth Ox also contains the source of wealth, making it a huge fortune. Furthermore, the earthly branch Ox also contains the Direct Officer Yin Water, which is also under control by her, making Kanna Hashimoto a formidable force in both men and financial success.

Starting from the Wood Rat Decade Luck in 2008, Kanna Hashimoto's Yang Wood element as the Seal nourished Yang Fire during the five-year cycle. She was well taken care of during her childhood. In 2013, when she entered the Rat period, the Water element became dominant. The year heavenly stem was also Yin Water, and in the early November, the month heavenly stem was Yang Water, with all those factors boosting the water element, her birth chart presented a beautiful scene of the sun shining on the surface of a lake This led to her sudden rise to fame on the internet, and marked the beginning of her career as an artist.

Starting from the Water Pig Decade Luck in 2018, Kanna Hashimoto continued to be influenced by the Water element. In the Water Rat month of the Water Tiger year in 2022, she hosted the Kohaku Uta Gassen, one of Japan's most prestigious music shows, and shone brightly. From 2028, she will enter the Water Dog Decade Luck, and the first five years of this period will be another peak in her career. This conclusion is consistent with Vedic astrology analysis. In 2031, around December, there will be a mature point in the Jupiter dasha. At this time, the good luck given by heaven will bring inevitable success in her life, at least in her career, such as the launch of her representative works and sweeping multiple awards. If she is still unmarried at this point, it is highly likely that she will step into the hall of marriage. In short, it is the highlight of her life.

Afterwards, from 2037 to 2057, Kanna Hashimoto will experience a great period of financial fortune, and she may no longer work as an actress to pursue business and acquire great wealth. However, as she grows older, her fortune will decline significantly, especially starting in 2058 when she enters the Earth Goat Decade Luck, which clashes with the earthly branch Ox. This, together with earthly branch Dog, forming a triple penalty that severely suppresses the Direct Officer Yin Water inside earthly branch Ox. This is also known as the pattern of harm officer meets official. In the year of 2063, when the Direct Officer Yin Water is prominent again, her husband may encounter misfortune, or if she is unmarried, her career may suffer a setback.
